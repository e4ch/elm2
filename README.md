# ELM2
Reverse engineering the analog telephone PTT Tritel ELM2

Note: This is work in progress.
- IMG_9916.jpg (raw) and IMG_9916_cut.jpg (rotated and cut) is a photo of the top side of the PCB
- scan_pcb_elm2.jpg is a scan of the lower side of the PCB
- scan_pcb_elm2_lowres.psd is a Photoshop 7 Elements file of both of the above merged (two layers) where you can adjust the opacity to view both the connections and components (unfortunately with reduced resolution; the original is 300MB, but GitHub only allows max. 25MB files)
- schema_elm2_sketch.gif is a scan of the manual drawn connections based on the above images - first draft of the schematic
- **Schematic.pdf** is the current PDF export of the schematic in the kicad folder - second draft of the schematic and current state
The connections should be fine, but very chaotic still.

I always assumed that the RJ9 connector to the handset with the four cables goes directly to the microphone and speaker. I've opened the handset to check which is which and found a whole new PCB in there too:
- IMG_0208.HEIC is a photo of the PCB
- pcb_small_back.jpg is a scan of the backside of that PCB
- pcb2_lores.psd is a combined Photoshop 7 Elements file of both of the above merged (two layers) where you can adjust the opacity to view both the connections and components (unfortunately with slightly reduced resolution because GitHub only allows 25MB files max.)
- schema_elm2_pcb2_sketch.gif is a photo of the manual drawn connections based on these images - first draft of the schematic for PCB2
