# ELM2
Reverse engineering the analog telephone PTT Tritel ELM2

Note: This is work in progress.
- IMG_9916.jpg (raw) and IMG_9916_cut.jpg (rotated and cut) is a photo of the top side of the PCB
- scan_pcb_elm2.jpg is a scan of the lower side of the PCB
- scan_pcb_elm2_lowres.psd is a Photoshop 7 Elements file of both of the above merged (two layers) where you can adjust the opacity to view both the connections and components (unfortunately with reduced resolution; the original is 300MB, but GitHub only allows max. 25MB files)
- schema_elm2_sketch.gif is a scan of the manual drawn connections based on the above images - first draft of the schematic
- **Schematic.pdf** is the current PDF export of the schematic in the kicad folder - second draft of the schematic and current state
The connections should be fine, but very chaotic still.
